# Why We Should Stop Using the Spring Framework

The Spring Framework has long dominated the Java landscape, promising convenience, quick setup, and flexibility through dependency injection and powerful abstractions. But does it deliver on those promises without long-term trade-offs? Here's why Spring, often seen as a quick win for developers, could end up causing more harm than good.

## The Illusion of Convenience

Spring markets itself as a framework that makes development easy and fast, especially with its annotations and code generation. These features may save time in initial setup, but as projects grow, so do the hidden costs. Spring's quick wins often backfire, adding significant maintenance overhead as debugging and enhancements become increasingly challenging.

Spring's abstraction can lead to a steep learning curve if you need to do anything outside of Spring's typical use cases. Often, this means diving deep into Spring's configuration options or "magic" methods, making debugging and troubleshooting a lengthy ordeal.
