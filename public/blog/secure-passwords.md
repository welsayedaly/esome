# Are you sure that your passwords are secure?

Access data or credentials are environment-specific configuration settings whose management requires strict methods for safeguarding by their users. A storage of these credentials in various environments that is both gapless and secure as well as a confidential handling represents a challenge for access authorization and secure recording.

Modern methods simplify these processes and allow a secure management and storage of passwords in different environments for different apps. One of those methods is the use of HashiCorp Vault, which centrally saves and manages passwords by use of various mechanisms, such as key/value or dynamic processes.

Also, Spring offers a high-level abstraction of HashiCorp Vault â€” which is called "Spring Vault" -, which features a client-side support for existing Spring applications and thus simplifies the transition to HashiCorp Vault. Spring Vault offers REST interfaces for the access to the passwords that are saved in HashiCorp. A short explanation of the use of these two new technologies illustrates their benefits.

## The Problem with Traditional Password Management

Many organizations still store passwords in configuration files, environment variables, or worse, hardcoded in applications. This approach has numerous security vulnerabilities:

1. **Limited Audit Trail**: Who accessed what and when?
2. **No Rotation Policies**: Passwords remain unchanged for extended periods
3. **Difficult Revocation**: Removing access is complicated
4. **Secret Sprawl**: Credentials duplicated across multiple systems

## Introducing HashiCorp Vault

HashiCorp Vault addresses these challenges by providing a central system for managing secrets with strong access controls, encryption, and audit logging.
