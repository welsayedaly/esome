# Deploy MongoDB Replica Sets in Kubernetes with HELM

In this tutorial, I will show you how to deploy two or more Replica Set MongoDB instances running on Kubernetes.

MongoDB is one of the most popular document stores available both as a fully managed cloud service and for the deployment on self-managed infrastructures.

Kubernetes is the industry-leading container orchestration platform.

## Why MongoDB on Kubernetes?

Running MongoDB on Kubernetes offers several advantages:

1. **Automatic Failover**: Kubernetes can detect failed pods and restart them automatically
2. **Simplified Scaling**: Scale your MongoDB deployment with simple commands
3. **Consistent Deployments**: Define your MongoDB configuration as code
4. **Resource Optimization**: Kubernetes can efficiently allocate resources to your database

This tutorial walks through setting up a production-ready MongoDB deployment using Helm charts.
