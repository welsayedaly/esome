# CICDX Vercel Debug Issues

## Problems Identified:
1. CICDX page not loading on Vercel (shows mapbox div instead)
2. Google Analytics IDs were not properly replaced
3. Possible mapbox interference

## Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Fixed Google Analytics tracking IDs:
   - G-D7QS407D82 (properly set)
   - AW-17047641910 (properly set)
   - GT-W6KS5D8B (properly set)

2. ✅ Fixed Facebook Pixel img alt attribute

## Potential Issues & Solutions:

### Issue 1: Mapbox Global Interference
The Contact component loads a Map component with mapbox, which might be interfering globally.

**Test**: Try accessing /cicdx directly in browser on Vercel

### Issue 2: React Router on Vercel
Vercel might need a rewrite rule for client-side routing.

**Solution**: Add vercel.json file:
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

### Issue 3: Build/Runtime Environment
CICDX page might have a runtime error not visible in local dev.

**Test**: Check browser console on Vercel deployment

## Next Steps:
1. Check if vercel.json exists for routing
2. Test direct URL access
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Consider temporarily removing mapbox to isolate issue
